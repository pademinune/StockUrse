My own chess bot in python (it's not good at chess). After every move, it will print the current board to the console.

If you want to play as black, set 'youAreWhite' to 'False'.

In order to make your move, you need to input the current coordinate of the piece (in algebraic notation) followed by the destination seperated by a space.

Sample Input:

e2 e4

This moves the piece on e2 to e4. In the original starting position, this would move a pawn to e4.

You can also run it in this replit, however it will take much longer to think (usually around 10 seconds): https://replit.com/join/awunerszee-justinnitoi1
