My own chess bot in python (it's not good at chess).

If you want to play as black, set 'youAreWhite' to 'False'.

In order to make your move, you need to input the current coordinate of the piece (in algebraic notation) followed by the destination seperated by a space.

Sample Input:

e2 e4

This moves the piece on e2 to e4. In the original starting position, this would move a pawn to e4.
